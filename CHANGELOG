    DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:
     v0.61  (Jacobi22; 04 Feb, 2018)
     - only remove some multi dimensional language indizes
     + add own Changelog-File 

     v0.60  (Christian Sommer; 04 Apr, 2008)
     + updated module to use the edit CSS functions introduced with the WB 2.7 core (only shows up if WB 2.7 or higher is used)

     v0.52  (Christian Sommer; 03 Apr, 2008)
     + updated edit CSS functions to include module backend.css into the <head> instead of <body> section if possible

     v0.51  (Christian Sommer; 02 Apr, 2008)
     + some code clean-up

     v0.50  (Christian Sommer; 30 Mar, 2008)
     + fixed wrong handling of stripslashes and $wb->strip_slashes(), thanks to thorn
     + added ` quotes for all DB queries table names and fields to prevent issues with MySQL special chars like -
     + added support for multi-lingual module description introduced with WB 2.7
     + changed mechanism to prevent files from beeing accessed directly (redirect instead off displaying an error message)

     v0.48  (Christian Sommer; 29 Mar, 2008)
     + fixed issue with optional module files 
       (it was not possible to edit the module files of module 2-x if more than one module was used on a page)

     v0.47  (Christian Sommer; 24 Jan, 2008)
     + re-introduced name and id attributes (but with different values)
         (modified edit_css.php to make the textareas work if codepress framework is not installed)

     v0.46  (Christian Sommer; 20 Jan, 2008)
     + fixed issue with Codepress and Internet Explorer 7.0 on WinXP

     v0.45  (Christian Sommer; 18 Dec, 2007)
     + added generic solution to edit frontend.css and backend.css module files
       HOW IT WORKS:
         a) add files: edit_css.php and css.functions.php to your module
         b) include css.functions.php in the modify.php of your module
         c) call function: css_edit() in your modify.php where you want to display the Edit CSS button
         d) customize the button style via backend.css (div.mod_moduldir_edit_css, div.mod_helloworld_edit_css a)

     v0.44  (Christian Sommer; 12 Dec, 2007)
     + added Dutch langauge file provided by Eki (thanks)

   v0.43  (Christian Sommer; 29/09/2007)
     + fixed typo in comments of install.php (update.php -> upgrade.php); thanks to Ralf(Berlin)

   v0.42  (Christian Sommer; 08/07/2007)
     + corrected some typos (version released on addons repository; replaces v0.30)

   v0.41  (Christian Sommer; 07/25/2007)
     + hard coded all hello world DB-table names: mod_$module_directory => mod_helloworld
        On some servers, the WB installation procedure fails if the modules DB-tables are defined
        with the variable $module_directory defined in the info.php file. 
         Also this error occurs only sporadically (most likely depending on server settings), it
         is highly recommended, to hard code all module DB-tables to ensure compatibility with all
         known systems!!
     + added timestamp to display date/time when hello world text was added to DB
         (date and time format can be defined in the language files DE/EN)
     + added check to view.php/modify.php to include CSS definitions file to the body if the functions
         register_frontend_function/register_backend_function are not available (WB < 2.6.7)

   v0.40  (Christian Sommer; 07/15/2007)
     + the hello world module was completely rewritten from v0.30 to v0.40
     + added purpose, loading mechanisms and variable/function description to all files
     + added individual licence terms and disclaimer to all files
     + added language support (GERMAN, ENGLISH)
     + added backend.css and frontend.css introduced with WB v2.6.7
     + added backend.js and frontend.js introduced with WB v2.6.7
     + measures to prevent security vulnerabilities (at least pointed to important things)

   v0.30  (Matthias Gallas, MM/DD/YYYY)
    + releases hello world module on the Add-Ons repository

   v0.20  (Travis Huizenga, MM/DD/YYYY)
    + initial release of the hello world module in the WB Community forum
